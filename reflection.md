During this assignment I talked with Dani about our code. 
During the course of the week I went to office hours on Tuesday morning and I went to tutoring on Monday? These are my approximations. I also met with Jordan on Friday. We discussed that I took a different approach when building the chat bot and I have decided to keep that in. 
Initially, I think that Java is very tempermental and particular and I'm already starting to hate brackets but that is ok. 
I think I'm still at a point where I think through things very procedurally. When we talked in class on Thursday about memory models I feel like I slowly began to see how everything is understood through objects. 
I was able to get everything to work however my code has a lot of redundancies. Through further rounds of iteration I think I could simplify my code by creating a for loop that runs through each of my stop words with a nested for loop that runs through each word in the user's repsonse. 

Post-Correction Reflection:
There were errors caused because I didn't set the value of num rounds. I went in an set the number to -1 and that changes when the user enters input. When I searched for the letter "i" in the user response, I surrounded it by spaces because I wanted to find only when i is used as a pronoun. However, when I split the string I split each word by the spaces so when "i" is found it will be the pronoun i.
