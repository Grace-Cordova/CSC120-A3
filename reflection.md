During this assignment I talked with Dani about our code. During the course of the week I went to office hours on Tuesday morning and I went to tutoring on Monday? These are my approximations. 
Initially, I think that Java is very tempermental and particular and I'm already starting to hate brackets but that is ok. 
I think I'm still at a point where I think through things very procedurally. When we talked in class on Thursday about memory models I feel like I slowly began to see how everything is understood through objects.
